Step 1: Clarifying the modeling approach There is no single, simple equation that can be used to derive the exact final geometry for all three scenarios. This is a complex problem in rheology that requires numerical methods to solve. The equations provided below are the fundamental constitutive equations and principles used in these models, not a simple formula that you can solve for a final shape. The shape of the Silly Putty depends on its viscoelastic properties, specifically how its viscosity and elasticity change with the rate of deformation (strain rate). For a given mass, the final geometry is an outcome of the material's internal resistance to flow and deformation under the influence of gravity and inertia. Step 2: Equations for a putty blob at rest (low strain rate) For a blob of Silly Putty oozing on a horizontal plane, the primary mechanism is viscous creep under the influence of its own weight (gravity). Over a long period, it behaves like a very viscous fluid. The rate of deformation is governed by the creep compliance function, \(J(t)\), which relates strain (\(\varepsilon \)) to a constant applied stress (\(\sigma _{0}\)). A simple, linear model often used to approximate this is the Burgers model. The creep compliance for the Burgers model is:\(J(t)=\frac{1}{E_{1}}+\frac{t}{\eta _{1}}+\frac{1}{E_{2}}\left(1-e^{-t/\tau }\right)\)where: \(\varepsilon (t)=\sigma _{0}J(t)\)\(\sigma _{0}\) is the constant stress (due to gravity, \(\sigma _{0}\approx \rho gh\)).\(E_{1}\) and \(E_{2}\) are elastic moduli.\(\eta _{1}\) and \(\eta _{2}\) are viscosities.\(\tau =\eta _{2}/E_{2}\) is the retardation time. The final "equilibrium" shape is a flat puddle whose thickness is determined by its mass \(x\) and the surface area it covers. The time it takes to reach that state is governed by the viscosity (\(\eta _{1}\)) and mass. Step 3: Equations for a putty blob dropping at 1 m/s and 10 m/s (intermediate and high strain rates) For a dropping and impacting blob of Silly Putty, the dominant physics are the interplay between elasticity, viscosity, and inertia. The material's response changes dramatically with the speed of impact. This is a problem of impact mechanics and fluid dynamics that requires numerical simulation. The fundamental equations are the Navier-Stokes equations coupled with a viscoelastic constitutive model. Navier-Stokes equations (conservation of momentum):where:\(\rho \) is the density.\(\mathbf{v}\) is the velocity vector. is the total stress tensor.\(\mathbf{g}\) is the acceleration due to gravity.Viscoelastic constitutive model (e.g., Oldroyd-B model):The stress tensor, , is defined by a constitutive equation that includes both viscous and elastic components. The Oldroyd-B model is a more advanced representation than the linear models mentioned previously and is often used to model polymer fluids.where: is the stress tensor.\(\lambda _{1}\) is the relaxation time.\(\lambda _{2}\) is the retardation time.\(\eta _{0}\) is the zero-shear-rate viscosity. is the strain rate tensor.\(\frac{\mathcal{D}}{\mathcal{D}t}\) is the upper-convected time derivative, which accounts for the rotation of the material. 1 m/s impact (intermediate strain rate): At this speed, the putty will likely flatten and spread out significantly upon impact. The viscous component dominates over the elastic component, and the blob behaves more like a very thick fluid. The final flattened shape is a result of the dissipation of kinetic energy into heat through viscous flow.10 m/s impact (high strain rate): At this speed, the strain rate is extremely high. The elastic component of the putty's behavior dominates the response. The putty's polymer chains do not have enough time to disentangle and flow, so it behaves like a brittle elastic solid. The impact will likely cause the blob to shatter and fragment into multiple pieces rather than flatten into a single puddle.
